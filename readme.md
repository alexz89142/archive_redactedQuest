## FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES
This is old code that I wrote when I first started programming that I figured I should upload for archival purposes. It is working code but it is not indicative of my current programming style and is not intended to be able to be built or run outside of a development environment

## **⚠️ Warning ⚠️** 
This code is part of a refactor project. This code is very old, not completely functional, rudimentary, and at least partly deprecated. It lacks many modern and standard programming conventions and therefore is hard to read, improve, and debug. This is kept here to show as an archive and the benefits of a refactor but is not meant to be taken seriously or learn from on its own

# Redacted Quest (Archive For Refactor)
Redacted Quest, named so because a lot of content was redacted because for privacy and copyright reasons. It's one of my first ever projects where I wanted to develop a game. It doesn't utilize a game engine, or even standard conventions like OOP as this is before I learned those.

I had just started programming and was very ambitious about wanting to create a game. Originally Redacted Quest was a card game featuring:

- Multiplayer (P2P via Peer.js)
- Account creation and persistence
- A shop for buying new cards
- Deck management
- A fully fledged UI including art for all the cards and panels
- A soundtrack (playing via Howler.js)

Being unaware of the proper tools to create such an application, it uses regular HTML5 including

- Plain JavaScript with Jquery, Peer.js, and Howler.js libraries
- CSS with Bootstrap
- PHP for data persistence (used files to store account instead of a database)

Despite how rudimentary it was, it was fully functional in its day and friends of mine played it. This project taught me the importance of understanding and utilizing programming conventions, as the lack of using them halted the progress of the game as it was too difficult to debug.

This code is now archived and part of revival project using proper conventions and tools
